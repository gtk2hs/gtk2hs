# see glib-genmarshal(1) for a detailed description of the file format,
# possible parameter types are:
#   VOID        indicates   no   return   type,  or  no  extra
#               parameters. if VOID is used as  the  parameter
#               list, no additional parameters may be present.
#   BOOLEAN     for boolean types (gboolean)
#   CHAR        for signed char types (gchar)
#   UCHAR       for unsigned char types (guchar)
#   INT         for signed integer types (gint)
#   UINT        for unsigned integer types (guint)
#   LONG        for signed long integer types (glong)
#   ULONG       for unsigned long integer types (gulong)
#   ENUM        for enumeration types (gint)
#   FLAGS       for flag enumeration types (guint)
#   FLOAT       for single-precision float types (gfloat)
#   DOUBLE      for double-precision float types (gdouble)
#   GLIBSTRING      for string types (gchar*)
#   BOXED       for boxed (anonymous but reference counted) types (GBoxed*)
#   POINTER     for anonymous pointer types (gpointer)
#   NONE        deprecated alias for VOID
#   BOOL        deprecated alias for BOOLEAN

# One discrepancy from Gtk+ is that for signals that may pass NULL for an object
# reference, the Haskell signal should be passed a 'Maybe GObject'.
# We therefore have two variants that are marshalled as a maybe type:
#
#   OBJECT      for GObject or derived types (GObject*)
#   MOBJECT      for GObject or derived types (GObject*) that may be NULL

# Furthermore, some objects needs to be destroyed synchronously from the main loop of
# Gtk rather than during GC. These objects need to be marshalled using TOBJECT (for thread-safe
# object). It doesn't hurt to use TOBJECT for an object that doesn't need it, except for the
# some performance. As a rule of thumb, use TOBJECT for all libraries that build on package
# 'gtk' and use OBJECT for all packages that only need packages 'glib', 'pango', 'cairo',
# 'gio'. Again both variants exist. Note that the same names will be generated for OBJECT and
# TOBJECT, so you have to remove the OBJECT handler if you need both.
#
#   TOBJECT      for GObject or derived types (GObject*)
#   MTOBJECT      for GObject or derived types (GObject*) that may be NULL

# If you add a new signal type, please check that it actually works!
# If it is a Boxed type check that the reference counting is right.
